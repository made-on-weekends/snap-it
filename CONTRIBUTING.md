## 🛠️ Contribution Workflow

We follow a standard fork-and-pull model:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Fork Repo] --> B[Create Branch]
    B --> C[Implement Changes]
    C --> D[Run Local Tests]
    D --> E[Submit PR]
    E --> F[Review & Merge]
```

### 1. Set Up Your Environment
1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/snap-it.git
   cd snap-it
   ```
3. Set up the upstream remote to stay synchronized with the main repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/made-on-weekends/snap-it.git
   ```

### 2. Branching Strategy
Always create a descriptive branch name from the main branch. Do not work directly on `main`:
- Features: `feature/descriptive-name`
- Bugfixes: `bugfix/descriptive-name`
- Documentation: `docs/descriptive-name`
- Performance/Refactoring: `refactor/descriptive-name`

```bash
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-branch-name
```

### 3. Writing Code & Documentation
- Maintain consistent coding style with the existing codebase.
- Keep changes concise, focused, and minimal. Avoid bundling unrelated fixes together.
- Update relevant documentation and comments if you introduce new capabilities or edit existing workflows.

### 4. Commit Messages
Commit messages should be descriptive and conventional. Focus on the *why* as well as the *what*:
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., `feat: add relative time parsing` instead of `added relative time parsing`).
- Prefix your commits when applicable:
  - `feat:` (New feature)
  - `fix:` (Bug fix)
  - `docs:` (Documentation changes)
  - `style:` (Formatting, missing semi-colons, no code change)
  - `refactor:` (Refactoring production code)
  - `test:` (Adding or correcting tests)
